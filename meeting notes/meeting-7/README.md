Progress Update:
  - Hannah is done the risk analysis section and has added it to the template
  - Andrew and James are pretty much done with the requirements section
  - Aimee is almost done with the project costing section
  - Yangyang and Autumn had made a rough plan for stage 2, but it was missing some information
  - Andrew, Hannah, and James have finished their sections and suggested that they move onto the usability section. They will hold a meeting this saturday at 7pm.
    - James recommended Adobe XD for creating mock-ups
    - Maybe create a sitemap or at least discuss the architecture
  - Once everyone has finished their section, send it to Autumn to add to the template
  
Project plans:
  - We have no information systems students in our team, which cuts out the need to do much marketing stuff (in stage 3)
  - Our exams will be taking place during December, which we must plan around
    - 7th Data Communications and Networking: everyone
    - 10th Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents: everyone
    - 14th Foundations 1: everyone but Blazej
    - 17th Knowledge Management: just Blazej
  - We discussed what we would want to do in stage 2:
    - Company website
      - Hannah and James volunteered for this
      - Just needs 1-3 pages: home page, about us (could be on home page), contact page (not a necessity but we should have some sort of contact info on there)
      - Could be done in a week/week and a half
    - Exposure implementation
      - Everyone will be ivolved in this, although Hannah and James will be busy for the start
      - We need to get about half of this done in stage 2
      - Database design and implementation
        - Andrew volunteered, and we may need 1 other person on this
      - Setting up a testing server
        - James volunteered
      - Front end
        - Autumn, Hannah, and Blazej are the front end developers
      
Implementation Plans:
  - We have to get the database done first, then user accounts, and then create a file in php to connect to the database, then uploading pictures
    - We can create just 1 file for connecting to the database and reference to it whenever we want to read/write to the database 
    - Once we have finished this file, test it (first iteration?)
  - Order of tasks: db, user accounts, connect to db, uploading pictures, creating challenges and joining challenges,
  - You can both add and follow a person, and you can change the privacy of your images to chose who they will be shown to
  - Filterable feed rather than a bunch of different ones
    - Filter by: location, recommended, popular, tag, post type (you can pick more than one so long as they aren't contradictory)
  - Subsystem for posts
    - should get this working asap, as other things rely on it
    - 2 or 2 and a half weeks
    - get the database done, create a php file for send stuff to database, create php file to recieve image link and id from database, javascript file to display? 
        
-------------------------

    - Create a mock-up of the platform
  - Sub-group meeting Saturday at 7 for those doing usability
