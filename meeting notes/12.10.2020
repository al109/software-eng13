Platform ideas:

  - A cross between instagram and geocaching
    - Gather info on local ‘landmarks’ from google maps or trip advisor using given location
      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37607643/how-to-get-landmarks-points-of-interest-near-a-given-location-using-google-pla
    - Maybe split ‘landmarks’’ into categories like natural landmarks, buildings, historical sites, activities etc.

  - Wildlife photography
    - Get local wildlife from wiki (by local I mean the same country not exact locations)
    - Local wildlife checklist can be a feature 
      - Can maybe sort into categories like bug, bird, mammal, etc.
      - Maybe can sort by likelihood of sighting which is based on either population or number of images with that tag on the platform?)
      - Users will have a kind of pokedex of wildlife they have ‘captured’

  - A few different feeds/tabs (think fb feed, marketplace, videos, profile, etc. at top of page)
    - Profile page
      - Your posts
      - Your platform score
      - Maybe editable page, probably going to be very difficult
      - Essentially a portfolio 
      - Users can view a slideshow of your work
      - Map of your activity/photos (might be unsafe? Maybe make it private)
    - Explore page
      - Popular users’ posts
      - Popular posts in general
      - Posts from people you follow
      - Suggested accounts and tags
    - Local page
      - Posts from local people (ones that you follow and ones that you don’t are mixed)
      - Local ‘events’ and challenges
      - Wildlife and landmark checklists?
    - Map section (could be included on another page)
      - Shows areas of platform activity
      - Users can create their own ‘landmarks’ like geocaching
      - Local landmark and wildlife info appear beside the map?
      - Challenges for each area may appear at the side
      - Maybe we could do different map overlays for challenges, landmarks, photos, wildlife? May be difficult tho
    - Leaderboards (could be included on another page)
      - Users can create their own mini leaderboards for their followers
        - Stuff like ‘best photo with [theme/object/landmark/creature]’, ‘funniest photo’, ‘who among us has the most points’, ‘most [locations/landmarks/creatures] pictured’
      - Basic platform leaderboards are here
        - Most points internationally/nationally/locally
        - Best rated photos
        - Best photos in certain tags and locations
      - Points are given for being in top 3 by a deadline (user defined for user made, and weekly for in-built)
      - List of suggested leaderboards based on your photo tags and location?

  - Post types:
    - Photo posts
    - Text posts
    - Share point score
    - Challenges 
      - Hide and seek
      - Created landmarks (geocaching type thing)
      - Photo challenges
      - Leaderboards
      - Jigsawed photos
    - Polls
    - Share others posts
    - Events 

  - Other features
    - Get points for everything you do, different amounts for different things based on the importance of that action to keeping an active website 
      - Eg more points for photo posts, being rated highly, creating challenges, winning challenges or topping leaderboards, less points for rating other  people, text posts, 
        polls etc.
      - Higher user scores make their posts appear first on the explore/local page, any other benefits?

  - Considerations 
    - Need to be quite a pretty website as it’s about photography
    - What can we do to keep faces off this site?
    - How do we make this safe with all the location sharing?




Group notes:

To do for next time:
  - Come up with team name and site name (ideas: captura, exposure, photari) and logo
  - Take notes on requirements
  - Keep coming up with ideas, polish the ones we do have
  - Figure out what languages we will need to use and work on them
    - We know java, js, html, css, python, sql 
  - Read up on project management
